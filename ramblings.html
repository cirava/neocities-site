                    <b>"Love For The Steam Deck" 2/4/25</b><br>
                    I think one of my favorite things is tweaking with software in various ways. For instance, one of
                    my favorite things that I own is a Steam Deck OLED, and I just adore messing
                    with the various ways to "softmod" it (AKA, just changing aspects of the gaming mode layer). Adding
                    functionality like being able to see ProtonDB ratings on game pages, custom themes, a manager for connected 
                    AirPods, and even a really solid screen recorder. Even beyond that, I just love tweaking and adding 
                    functionality that could be done without DeckyLoader. Using EmuDeck to get easy access to emulators is a
                    big one I love doing. My little cousins loved being able to watch me play MK8DX when I brought my Deck to
                    my Grandma's one time to kill some possible down time while I was there. I do just have this inclination to
                    tweak with what I own and use software-wise, I think it's why I've become so interested with Linux as of late.
                    Unfortunately my current desktop has had issues with it so I'm stuck with a logged out install of Windows 10, but
                    when I build my next PC I plan for it to be all AMD to possibly skirt these issues I've had with trying Linux,
                    which I suspect to be related to my NVIDIA card and poor monitor setup.
